# 2022-ecosystem
Code for the ecosystem Design Skills week

### Connected or simulated ecosystem
The `clientid` in settings.py should be unique and **can not contain any spaces!**


To work in either a connected ecosystem or a simulated ecosystem, make sure you have the correct parameter (True or False) chosen for the ```"connect_to_ecosystem= ???" ```
parameter in line 20 code.py.

### Change filename to creature.py
For all creature_example_x.py files, make sure to rename the files to creature.py (and remove the old one)

### Specifics
If you use creature_example_extra.py, change line 7 of the ecosystem.py file to:
```
offline_messages = ["Red&&&100", "Red&&&255", "Blue&&&50", "Blue&&&150", "Green&&&90", "Green&&&220"]
```
